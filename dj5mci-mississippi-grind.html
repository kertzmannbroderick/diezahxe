I was perusing what Prime had to offer and came across one of the most hideous looking posters for a movie that I've ever seen for a movie called Mississippi Grind starring Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds. I can't believe someone was paid to create it. The poster and the title made me think the movie was going to be some awful heist story and/or Rounders rip off, so I started it expecting to cringe. Without spoiling too much, I couldn't have been more wrong. Mendelsohn amp Reynolds are great.

I recently re-watched it with that being my second viewing. When I first saw it back last year it became my favourite film of 2015. It has two great characters being brought to life by two great actors who have great chemistry. There's nothing new or ground breaking about any of it but it tells a fantastic story and by it's end it feels complete although you could say the adventures could keep going. Based on some research it seems it gained some good reviews and quite a few mixed and bad which. Down-on-his-luck gambler Gerry and his hot-streak buddy Curtis hit the road for New Orleans hunting a big payday. On riverboats and racetracks they chase women and thrills—before risking it all in the wager of their lives. Hi, This is my first post here, anyway I just watched the movie Mississippi Grind and the ending kinda made me feel like nothing really happened with Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) From what it looked like, he had no actual plans of going to Peru seeing how he woke up with the waitress (the one Gerry called over to get a cheeseburger, at least I think that was her) and then started hitting on alice (random lady at the front desk of the hotel/a stranger), it made me believe he has no plans of actually. "Mississippi Grind" is co-written and co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the team behind the similarly '70s-influenced "Half Nelson" and "Sugar." It's bracing in its simplicity. It's a character portrait, period. It's just about psychology and the rhythms of friendship. So, why does Ryan Reynold's character helps Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) to begin with? I mean, he barely knows him. And why he wanted to get beat up in the basketball court.

Ben did an excellent job as always, but how the movie progressed leaved a lot to be desired imo. The movie had the feeling of a kind of impending doom, it was all very gritty and realistic - but they end up winning everything with this flawless luck that came out of nowhere ("we can't lose"). I thought it was a dream at first, but it wasn't. Then it just ends after this bizarre turn of events. I also thought we were going to really delve into the characters more, but it just kind of skimmed.
